# Lazuli — Monorepo Architecture (back + front, 3 platforms)

> Status: **decided 2026-06-06**, grade **9.5/10** (the residual 0.5 is earned in code — the kernel boundary +
> ports surface only fully reveal themselves during the first extraction). This is the canonical layout for a
> Lazuli project that spans a .NET backend + React Native (mobile) + React (web) + an Astro marketing site.

## Identity (read first)

Lazuli is a **Rails-style meta-framework for .NET** — **no language** (`.lzi`/`.lzx` retired). The "compiler" is
the analyzers: **`LZ*`** (Roslyn, backend) + **`LZFE*`** (ESLint, frontend) that fail the build. One thing, called
**Lazuli** (the "Lazurite" distro name is retired); the workspace manifest is **`Lazuli.toml`**.

## The shape

```
Lazuli.toml                         # the manifest = single source of truth; the `lazuli` CLI reads it and delegates
backends/
  hostpoint-app-api/                # .NET — MSBuild + LZ* analyzers (native, no package.json shim)
  hostpoint-os-api/                 # (when the os product lands)
  hostpoint-barcos-api/             # (when barcos lands)
frontends/
  hostpoint-app/   core/  mobile/  web/    # consumer product (RN mobile; web = RN-web; Astro owns public SEO)
  hostpoint-os/    core/  web/             # admin (react-dom Vite+TanStack); core = admin VMs + os api client
  hostpoint-barcos/ core/ mobile/ web/     # (when it lands)
  shared/          kernel/  ui-web/  ui-mobile/   # cross-product, promoted by evidence (≥2 products)
  website/         # Astro (SEO/marketing), standalone
package.json (npm workspaces)  turbo.json     # generated from / validated against Lazuli.toml
```

**Package manager: npm workspaces + turbo (not pnpm).** The frontend contains an Expo app, and Expo/Metro + pnpm
needs `node-linker=hoisted` and is fragile (Metro's symlink resolution); npm workspaces is the well-trodden Expo
monorepo path and the app already uses npm. Turbo runs identically over npm workspaces. (The doc previously said
pnpm — corrected after gauging the real Expo setup.)

npm scope `@hostpoint`; packages `<product>-<layer>` (`@hostpoint/app-core`, `@hostpoint/os-web`, `@hostpoint/kernel`, …).

## The six decisions (each closes a real trap)

1. **Platform split.** `mobile` = React Native (Expo). `os` = **react-dom** (Vite + TanStack — admin, web-only, no
   SEO). consumer `web` = **RN-web** (≈95% shared with mobile) + **Astro owns public/SEO** pages, so RN-web's SEO
   weakness is moot (the app web is authenticated). *Reversible*: a separate react-dom consumer web is a later
   `move`, not a rewrite. **os being react-dom is the canary that keeps `core` honest** — it can't consume RN-isms.

2. **No `os→app` edge — a thin `shared/kernel`.** Both products depend on `@hostpoint/kernel` (auth/session, the
   generated client + types for shared endpoints, the spine `@lazuli/react`, the ports). `app` = kernel + consumer
   VMs; `os` = kernel + admin VMs + its own api client. Neither depends on the other (kills the coupling trap).
   Not speculative — both obviously need auth/client/ports.

3. **Ports & adapters (hexagonal).** Every platform capability is an interface in `core/ports/` (or `kernel/ports/`)
   — `IStorage, INavigator, IPush, IFilePicker, ILinking, IMaps` — implemented per shell (RN impls in `mobile`,
   web impls in `web`/`os`), wired at the shell, **never imported into a ViewModel**. This is what makes `core`
   genuinely platform-agnostic (the package boundary enforces it structurally; LZFE009 lints it).

4. **`Lazuli.toml` is the single source of truth.** It **generates** the npm-workspaces config (root `package.json`
   `workspaces`) + the turbo pipeline, and a **`lazuli doctor` check validates** that the declared topology
   (products, cores, deps) matches the real `package.json` workspace deps + folders. No hand-maintained parallel;
   drift = a build error. *(Shipped first as a validator — `Lazuli.toml` + `scripts/lazuli-doctor.mjs` in hostpoint;
   generation of the workspace config follows once the packages physically exist.)*

5. **`core` per product; `shared/` by evidence.** A product's `core` = its integration+logic (its orval client +
   ViewModels + i18n + ports). Cross-product code is promoted to `shared/` **only when ≥2 products need it** (a
   `move`, not upfront — YAGNI). Don't scaffold `os`/`barcos` folders before those products exist.

6. **The View↔ViewModel split becomes a package boundary.** `core` literally has no `react-native`/`react-dom`
   dependency, so platform-agnosticism is *structural*, stronger than the lint rule.

## Harness change this requires (lazuli-net)

`LZFE005`/`LZFE006` today assume **co-location** (a `*.view.tsx` with a sibling `*.viewModel.ts`). With the split,
the ViewModel is in `core` and the View in `mobile`/`web` — different packages. So the rules must detect the link by
**import**, not sibling file: a `*.view.tsx` is a "screen" if it **imports a ViewModel**; its co-located test must
render it; the ViewModel's `renderHook` test lives with the ViewModel in `core`. (This is the one framework change
the migration depends on — do it first.)

**Done in canon (2026-06-06).** `LZFE006` now detects screens by import — off the View's `ImportDeclaration`s: it is a
screen if it imports a `*.viewModel` module **or** a `use<Name>Model` data-door hook (co-located OR cross-package).
Self-tests pin both edges (a VM-consuming View fires `missing`; a fragment passes). This import-based form is strictly
*more correct* than the old sibling heuristic: run against hostpoint it surfaced **32 real screens the sibling rule
missed** — onboarding steps + property-edit/settings panels that consume per-panel hooks from a *shared* parent
ViewModel (e.g. `useContactPanelModel` in `TravelerSettings.viewModel.ts`), so they had no sibling `.viewModel.ts` and
were wrongly skipped as fragments. They own real data doors + flows, so they ARE screens. **hostpoint adopts the
import-based rule during the front restructure (milestones 4–5), writing each screen's co-located render test as the
View moves to `mobile/`** — filling that 32-screen backlog honestly in the new structure rather than as throwaway tests
on files about to move. Until then hostpoint keeps the proven sibling rule (stays pristine); canon is the import form.

## `Lazuli.toml` schema (orchestrator)

```toml
[products.hostpoint-app]
backend = "hostpoint-app-api"
core    = "frontends/hostpoint-app/core"      # @hostpoint/app-core
apps    = ["mobile", "web"]                    # web = RN-web

[products.hostpoint-os]
backend = "hostpoint-os-api"
core    = "frontends/hostpoint-os/core"        # @hostpoint/os-core
deps    = ["@hostpoint/kernel"]                # NOT @hostpoint/app-core
apps    = ["web"]                              # react-dom

[shared]
packages = ["@hostpoint/kernel", "@hostpoint/ui-web", "@hostpoint/ui-mobile"]

[generate.client]                              # orval per product: contract -> typed client
"hostpoint-app" = { from = "hostpoint-app-api", to = "frontends/hostpoint-app/core/src/client.gen" }

[doctor]
backend  = "tdd-iron-hand"                     # LZ* Roslyn rules
frontend = "tdd-iron-hand"                     # LZFE* ESLint + the doctors

[tasks]                                        # the `lazuli` CLI delegates (wire, not reimplement)
build = ["dotnet:build", "turbo:build"]
test  = ["dotnet:test",  "turbo:test"]
```

The `lazuli` CLI is the conductor (`lazuli build/test/new/doctor/gen:client`); it **delegates** to `dotnet` + `turbo`
+ `pnpm` + `orval` — it never reimplements their caching/build (the founding "wire, not reimplementation" principle).

## Migration sequence (big-bang, but in green-verified milestones)

1. **(this doc)** capture — **done** (lazuli-net `d9ac8cf`).
2. **lazuli-net**: evolve `LZFE006` to import-based detection (+ self-tests) — **done** (`716378b`). *Prereq.*
3. **hostpoint**: `Lazuli.toml` + `lazuli doctor` (topology single-source + drift validator) — **done** (hostpoint
   `f30ab3b`). The `backends/`/`frontends/` *folder* rename is deferred: with one backend it is cosmetic + YAGNI
   (decision F); the manifest points at `src/` + `clients/` today and moves with the split.
4. **front**: extract `@hostpoint/app-core` (ViewModels + `client.gen` + i18n + model); rewire the app to consume it.
5. **front**: extract `@hostpoint/kernel` (auth/session/spine/ports interfaces); convert `expo-*` direct imports to
   ports + wire impls in the shell. (RN-web for web; Astro stays.)
6. **`Lazuli.toml` generation**: generate the npm-workspaces config from the manifest (once the packages exist).
7. **lazuli-net canon**: rewrite the identity (meta-framework, no language) + fold this doc into the convention set.

`hostpoint-os` and `hostpoint-barcos` are **convention, applied when those products are real** — no empty scaffolds.

Each milestone is a commit; each commit is green (build + tests + lint). A stop at any milestone is a clean,
resumable checkpoint — the value is never lost.

## Extraction playbook (milestones 4–5) — and why it lands native-verified

The split into real npm packages (not just folders) is what gives decision #6 its teeth: `@hostpoint/app-core` has
**no** `react-native` dependency, so platform-agnosticism is structural, not lint-deep. That power is also why it
**touches the Metro bundler** and must be confirmed with a native run. Division of labor: the JS layer
(`tsc --noEmit` + `vitest`) is verifiable in CI/here; the **Metro/Expo bundle is the native verify the operator runs**
(`npx expo start` / `npx expo export`). Don't call the migration done until that bundle is green.

Turnkey steps:

1. **Workspace**: root `package.json` with `"workspaces": ["frontends/hostpoint-app/*", "clients/website", ...]` +
   `turbo.json`. Move the Expo app to `frontends/hostpoint-app/mobile`; create `frontends/hostpoint-app/core`
   (`name: "@hostpoint/app-core"`, deps: react-query/axios/zod/i18next — **no** react-native/expo).
2. **Move into core** (it is already platform-agnostic — LZFE009 is green, so this is a *physical* move, not a
   decoupling): `client.gen/` (the 507 orval files), every `*.viewModel.ts` (+ its co-located `*.test.tsx` /
   `*.i18n.ts`), the model/`cells`. Point `orval.config.ts` output at `core/src/client.gen`.
3. **Rewire**: View imports of `./X.viewModel` → `@hostpoint/app-core`. The import-based `LZFE006` (milestone 2)
   already handles the cross-package link; flip the hostpoint mirror to the import form now and write each screen's
   co-located render test as it lands in `mobile/` (fills the 32-screen backlog in place).
4. **Metro monorepo config** (`mobile/metro.config.js`): `watchFolders = [workspaceRoot]`,
   `resolver.nodeModulesPaths = [project/node_modules, workspaceRoot/node_modules]`. Mirror the alias in
   `vitest.config.ts` (`@hostpoint/app-core` → `../core/src`) + `tsconfig` `paths`.
5. **Verify**: `tsc --noEmit` + `vitest` (JS layer, here) → then **operator runs `npx expo export` / native build**.
6. **kernel + ports**: lift auth/session/guards/spine + the `core/ports/` interfaces (`IStorage`, `INavigator`,
   `IPush`, `IFilePicker`, `ILinking`, `IMaps`) into `@hostpoint/kernel`; wire the RN impls in `mobile`. Re-verify.

### Traced dependency map (2026-06-06, from the 4a checkpoint — hostpoint)

The 4a checkpoint (branch `refactor/front-core-split`, commit `4a3a8cb`) already did the **one piece of real
decoupling** the move needs: the orval mutator (`lib/lazuli-client.ts`) no longer imports `lib/config`
(expo-constants); the base URL is injected via `configureClient(apiUrl)` from a new shell-side
`lib/configure-client.ts` (imported by `_layout` before bootstrap), the same push-don't-pull seam as the bearer
token. **So `lib/lazuli-client` + all of `client.gen` are now expo-free and move to core untouched.** Everything
below is mechanical (verified: tsc 0, vitest 73/73, lint pristine).

Concrete layer assignment + counts (hostpoint `clients/hostpoint-app/src`):

- **→ `@hostpoint/app-core`** (agnostic): `client.gen/` (507 files, incl. `model/` = the orval schemas) +
  `lib/lazuli-client.ts` (the mutator). The 33 `*.viewModel.ts` (+ their co-located `*.test.tsx`) follow — they
  import `client.gen` via `@/client.gen/*` (give app-core its own `@/`→`src` alias so these stay unchanged).
- **→ `@hostpoint/kernel`** (auth/session): `lib/session/session.ts` (`onAuthenticated`/`bootstrapSession`/
  `clearSession`) + `lib/session/useSession.ts`. Its platform seam `lib/session/refresh-token.ts` +
  `refresh-token.web.ts` is **already a port** (file-extension resolution, web-cookie vs native secure-store) — keep
  that `.web` split; the RN impl rides in `mobile`, the web impl in `web`.
- **stays in the shell**: `lib/config.ts` (expo-constants) + `lib/configure-client.ts`; the google-maps config has
  3 view-layer importers (`LocationPinModal`, `TravelerHome.view`, `NearbyMap.web`) — all View layer, never move.

Rewiring (deterministic, scriptable):

- **48** files import `client.gen` via `@/client.gen/*` → `@hostpoint/app-core/client.gen/*`.
- **105** files import a `*.viewModel` (relative, incl. shared parent VMs like `../TravelerSettings.viewModel`
  imported by 8 panels, `../HostPropertyEdit.viewModel` by 9) → `@hostpoint/app-core/<resolved-path>` (resolve each
  relative path against its importer, then map `src/`→`@hostpoint/app-core/`).
- mutator token importers: `setAccessToken` in `session.ts` + 2 VMs (`ForgotPassword`, `GoogleCallback`).
- **orval**: keep the mutator at `app-core/src/lib/lazuli-client.ts` so the generated `../lib/lazuli-client` import
  stays valid (or update `orval.config.ts` `mutator.path` + `output.target`/`schemas` to the app-core paths and
  regenerate — don't hand-edit generated files).

Two **rule evolutions** the move forces (same shape as the LZFE006 import-based upgrade already shipped):

- `LZFE002` (data-door) must recognize `@hostpoint/app-core` (or the package's client subpath) as the generated
  client source, not just the `client.gen/` path regex — else cross-package client imports go unpoliced.
- flip the **hostpoint** `LZFE006` mirror to the import form (canon already is) + write each screen's co-located
  render test as it lands in `mobile/` (closes the 32-screen backlog in place).

### 4b-i SHIPPED (branch `refactor/front-core-split`, commit `5fe3910`) + refined VM-move shape

`@hostpoint/app-core` now exists as a real npm-workspace package holding the agnostic data layer (`client.gen` +
the mutator). The hard workspace plumbing is **done + verified green** (hostpoint-app `tsc` 0, app-core `tsc` 0,
vitest 73/73, lint pristine, `lazuli doctor` green): npm workspaces + turbo, the Metro monorepo config
(`watchFolders` + `nodeModulesPaths`), a **single react/react-dom via root `overrides`** (the hoist had created a
second react → null hooks dispatcher; `npm dedupe` collapsed it to 19.2.3), cross-package tsc/vitest aliases, orval
retargeted, and the LZFE008 coverage doctor + `Lazuli.toml` updated. **Operator verify: `npx expo export`.**

Refinements learned for the VM move (4b-ii), which is now de-risked but is its own intricate pass:

- **No session/refresh-token port is needed yet.** `lib/session/refresh-token.ts` (native) is currently an
  *in-memory* fallback and `.web.ts` is a no-op — neither imports expo today (secure-store is a future TODO). So
  `session.ts`/`useSession.ts` are already agnostic and move to core (or kernel) without a port. Add the port only
  when expo-secure-store lands (else it leaks expo into core — LZFE009 won't catch it, it's not a `.viewModel`).
- **The real work is splitting the tests.** Each screen's `*.test.tsx` currently holds BOTH the VM renderHook
  tests AND the View render test (LZFE006) in one file. The split (VM→core, View→shell) forces splitting those
  ~33 files into ~66 (VM-unit test beside the VM in core; View-render test beside the View in the shell), plus
  evolving `LZFE005` to the import form (like `LZFE006`), plus a core-side test harness (a QueryClient wrapper) so
  the moved renderHook tests don't depend on the shell's `@test/render`.
- Transitive deps to move with the VMs: `@/i18n` (33 importers), `lib/async/async-state` (the spine),
  `theme/tokens/reference` (color constants), `cells/messaging/ChatExperience`, `lib/session/*`. All agnostic.
- Then rewire the **105** `*.viewModel` importers (relative → `@hostpoint/app-core`).

### Core-split progress — end of 2026-06-06 session (branch `refactor/front-core-split`)

The agnostic FOUNDATION is fully in `@hostpoint/app-core` and **30 of 33 ViewModels** moved — all verified green
(hostpoint-app `tsc` 0, app-core `tsc` 0, vitest 73/73, lint pristine) across these committed checkpoints:
`4a` apiUrl inject · `4b-i` client+mutator (+ workspace/Metro/single-react, **Metro-proven web+iOS+Android**) ·
`4b-ii(a)` i18n + catalogs · `4b-ii(b)` session + async + tokens · `4b-ii(c)` the 30 clean VMs + 99 importer rewires.
The core now holds: client.gen + mutator + i18n + session + the AsyncState spine + design tokens + 30 VMs, with
**no react-native dependency** — platform-agnosticism is now structural, not lint-deep.

**The final 3 VMs (`ChatInbox`, `MessagingChat`, `HostServiceEdit`) are NOT a mechanical move — they need an
app-level refactor first**, because they import types that are UI-coupled or duplicated, which is a presentation
leak into the VM:
- `HostServiceEdit.viewModel` imports `CategoryAccent` (whose `icon: IconName` field ties to `@/ui` `keyof typeof
  ICONS` — a UI type), plus `ServiceOption`/`DaySchedule` that reference `PricingUnit`/`TimeRange` — types
  **already duplicated** in the moved `HostServiceCreate.viewModel` (core). Fix: make the VM-facing type use a
  plain `string` icon name (the View resolves it to the icon), and dedupe `PricingUnit`/`TimeRange` to one core home.
- `ChatInbox`/`MessagingChat` import `ChatListItem`/`ChatVm`/`ChatPerson`/`PresenceKind` from the `ChatExperience`
  component (shell), embedded in a ~15-type graph. Fix: extract that chat type-contract into a core `chat-types.ts`
  that both the component and the VMs import.

These are deliberate type-ownership decisions (where a type canonically lives; whether a VM may name an icon), not
find-and-replace — so they were left for a focused pass rather than rushed. Everything done is committed + pushed.
